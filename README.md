safe and secure workflow apart, for proper SQL Schema validations  ORM used here is Drizzler, one can use Prisma or any preferred, For FrontEnd used Library are GSAP, and Shadcn for components
This Applicatuion not only provides a good Authentic Experience but also follows good industry practices such as converting user password in complex Hash such that database admin can not see the actial password
